# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security and privacy of our users seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities or potential threats in the 
project, we encourage you to report them to us promptly and responsibly. This allows us to assess, address, and disclose the issue to our users and take appropriate actions to ensure the security and integrity of our project.

To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Submit a detailed report of the vulnerability to our designated email address: security@snakegame.com. Please include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Any potential impact or exploit scenario
   - Version or commit hash of the project affected
   - Any additional relevant information

2. Our security team will review your report and investigate the issue.

3. We will maintain open communication with you throughout the process, providing updates on the progress of the investigation and any necessary actions.

4. Once the vulnerability is verified and addressed, we will acknowledge your contribution and provide credit (if desired) for responsibly reporting the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing any potential vulnerabilities or exploits before they have been addressed and a fix has been released. This practice, known as responsible disclosure, allows us to protect our users and provide adequate time to mitigate any potential risks.

We commit to the following:

- Promptly acknowledging receipt of your vulnerability report.
- Keeping you informed about the progress of the investigation.
- Addressing the vulnerability within a reasonable timeframe.
- Providing credit (if desired) for responsibly reporting the issue after it has been addressed.

## Exceptions

Please note that this security policy does not extend to third-party libraries or dependencies used in the Snake Game For Two project. If you discover a vulnerability in a third-party component, we encourage you to report it directly to the maintainers of that component.

## Disclaimer

While we strive to maintain the security and integrity of the Snake Game For Two project, we cannot guarantee the absence of all vulnerabilities. We appreciate your efforts in identifying and reporting any security issues, and we will work diligently to address them as quickly as possible.

Your cooperation in keeping the vulnerability details confidential and adhering to responsible disclosure practices is highly appreciated.
